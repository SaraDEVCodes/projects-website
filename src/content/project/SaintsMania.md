## Description
Saints Mania is another passion project born from the love of gundam and inspiration from a mecha game called Eschatos.

Saints Mania is a retro-styled 3D mecha action-RPG which had open-world aspects and a low-poly PlayStation2 graphics aesthetic.

This project was built along side a very close and talented friend of mine whom I respect very much. Together we started this project purely from passion, however, that friend has been gone for over 8 months and the project has not been updated since, the files are available and im able to continue working on it, but for now, no progress.
