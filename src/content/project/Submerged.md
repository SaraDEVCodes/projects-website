## Description

Submerged is the first game I developed, It's a project that definetly brings back a lot of nostalgia and memories.
It was part of a project to bring awareness to water pollution, so me and my team developed a game revolving around a golden-hearted fisherman's son called Cid.

Cid travels the coast coming from his dad's house and then from the port sails the ocean on a small rackety boat. He encounters seaguls and clams that attack him in the ocean but then gets past them and into the sewer.
In the sewer level it is revealed that there are some sketchy things going on that are polluting the water, deep in the sewers, Cid encounters a lab and it can be seen that there are multiple test tubes with some sort of creature growing inside them, this is when Cid meets Carnis, a genetically mutated saltwater creature.

This project's files were unfortunantly corrupt due to their old age and not being updated for over 3 years and are therefore unplayable, I still have the original github repository but the original tileset, enemy ai and UI failed to convert.
