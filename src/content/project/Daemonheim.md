## Description

This is my most recent and most polished project so far, it was also the first to be published publically for anyone to play and marks a milestone in my game developemnt career, It is another project that I’m deeply interested in and will pour my entire skillset into. I’ve always liked the idea of a tragic story with the same world style as Elden ring but with the aesthetic of NieR Automata, the melancholy of the game visuals and story is weirdly enticing to me.

In the game you play as a Queen, but this queen has been tricked by her people and into her death, but she was not killed. The kingdom believed the queen was dead and entered a new reign. However, those in power were responsible for the misunderstanding, so you are trying to regain your honour and kingdom by defeating the people responsible for plotting your death and turning the kingdom’s people against you. But first, you must escape the island they put you in and return to the mainland.
