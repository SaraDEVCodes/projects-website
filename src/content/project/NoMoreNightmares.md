## Description
No More Nightmares is a pixel-art, top-down horror game and was developed around the same time as my very first project Submerged, so this would make it the 2nd game I ever developed.

NMN revolves around a young woman called Mirror Image, you play the game through her depiction of her younger self when she was still attending highschool. You wake up in a hospital and try to solve puzzles to escape your mental state through these puzzles you relive Mirror Images's past trauma, along side this, you must watch your sanity metre in order to not be attacked by your traumas. Its a choice-based puzzle adventure game in which your choices will impact you and change your gameplay, even going as far as changing the look of the whole game.

It was way more complex mechanic-wise than my first game and was quite overwhelming for me and my team, we didnt get to finish it and I no longer have the files for it, therefore this is also unplayable.
